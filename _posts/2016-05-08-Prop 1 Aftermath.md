Alright, I rarely tackle political issues publicly, but I figured I'd weigh in on the whole Proposition 1 debacle that happened here in Austin this past weekend.  

I'll be upfront - I'm pretty biased for any initiative that would promote less reliance on personal vehicles but I've tried hard to be objective and studied all I could about both sides, and yet I can easily conclude that the people who voted against (successfully) Prop 1 have fallen victim to the needless fearmongering common to any political issue.

Before I start, I want to reiterate that I am very much for increasing the safety of **everybody**. I find it disgusting that people think it's okay to sexually assult people at all. Period. Having said that, I'd be very disappointed if anyone who knows me at all reads what I have to say about this issue and conclude that I could care less about the safety of ridesharers.

To those that don't know about it, Proposition 1 is basically an ordinance supported by ridesharing companies (Uber & Lyft) to reject proposed mandatory fingerprinting-based background checks proposed by the city's government. Prop 1 is essentially a defense for the companies' current state of operationss. This weekend, 56% of Austinites voted against Prop 1, and Uber+Lyft have said that they will be leaving Austin because of it. As of this post, many are unsure if the companies would stick to their guns, or if they'll conform to the new rules, but regardless I feel that a serious blow has been struck against Austin's fledging reputation as a city that welcomes innovation.

I'm surprised to find that a majority of my Austin acquaintances on social media very outspoken **against** Prop 1, and it seems to me that the rationale of most of the naysayers can be grouped into three camps:

### 1. Proposition 1 is going against laws that would make ridesharing genuinely safer.
By far the most reasonable camp, opponents who fall under this category think that Proposition 1 is just a selfish grab by the ridesharing companies to skirt new laws that would make the ridesharing experience safer for riders. On the surface, this seems like a reasonable assumption, and I can hardly blame anyone who don't know better for voting against Prop 1.  

However, this is simply not true. Carefully consider the reasons people use ridesharing services - either they don't have the means to drive their own car (lack of car) or they don't want to (traffic, inebriation etc). Now, we know that the ridesharing companies have stated that they will pull out of Austin if Prop 1 doesn't get passed, and now the people who would otherwise be using their services would have to get on the road. These include inexperienced drivers and [drunk drivers](http://www.fox7austin.com/news/local-news/57935567-story). 

But these points are, at best, hypothetical, so let's focus on some more facts - Uber's vetting system is already really comprehensive. Stringent criminal background checks (which Lyft & Uber already do) would reveal anything a fingerprint-based one would, and the only benefit a fingerprint-based background check has is the assurance that the person submitting the background check results is the same person as the one on the result. Although we see [time](http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/court-records-uber-agreed-to-tough-limits-on-backg/nq5GK/) and [time](http://www.fox7austin.com/news/local-news/57935567-story) again that fingerprint-based checks aren't any better at catching would-be criminals, fearmongerers see this pain point as easy ammunition to rally people to oppose the ordinance. 

"They just want to save costs! Follow the money!" - opponents may say, to get the masses all riled up. The truth is, though, Uber doesn't have to pay a dime to require stricter checks, they're not the ones doing them; the drivers themselves have to foot the bill to obtain prints and submit them for a background check. As someone who's looked into getting print-based checks to satisfy a visa requirement, let me tell you that they're both as expensive and as big a pain-of-an-ass as you'd expect, even for a technology that's literally decades old at this point. I'm not sure what you think of Uber drivers, but in my experience, most of them are honest, hardworking people doing it as an extra source of income because their day job can't quite make ends meet. So call me senseless, but I don't think it's fair to require an expensive and troublesome procedure for little to no gain. 

But the aforementioned battlecry may have some truth, because if we did "follow the money" we'd find that [traditional cab drivers](http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local/qa-what-austin-voters-need-to-know-about-the-prop-/nq9YN/) already need to go thorugh fingerprinting (and I'm sure I don't have to tell you about the crimes happening *there* regardless), and oh gee wouldn't it be convenient that the politicians they donate to made the big, bad ridesharing companies do the same?

### 2. Proposition 1 is a play by Big Corporate to subvert the government and regulate themselves.
I find it so funny that the people loudest against corporate regulations by the government in this case are usually the people loudest **against** government regulations and pro free markets 90% of the time. But let's put that pettiness aside and look at the argument here.  

So, opponents in this camp think that companies are strong-arming the government by providing an ultimatum - let us operate how we want to or we'll leave. They state that letting Prop 1 pass is a "slippery slope" to allowing any company to skirt any law they want, and it won't be long before we find outselves in a lawless, chaotic dystopia where mothers hide their kids indoors as ridesharers blaze down the streets in their [pink-mustachioed](http://images.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/lyft-1940x900_36455.jpg) cars.

Yeah I think that's pretty stupid. 

Anyone who's had to complete a college assignment talking about opinions regarding regulations and/or ethics knows about the [Slippery Slope Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope). At this point, I just turn my ears off whenever people mention that something is a "slippery slope" to *insert dystopian future here*. If we're gonna take every argument and blow it out of proportion based on **what it could be someday maybe** then we're better off not debating objectively about anything at all and cower in fear in the face of any attempts on innovation or breaking out of the norm.

I think this [article](http://www.dailytexanonline.com/2016/04/25/proposition-1-fears-rely-on-faulty-assumptions) says it best - "The case that Uber and Lyft are “strong-arming” the government into creating looser regulations is unfounded. The companies fought for the Prop 1 election using a citizen-based petition. The proposition will also be voted for by the people, so it will truly represent what the people want. Uber and Lyft fill the void of public transportation in Austin while simultaneously offering cheaper rates and lower wait times than taxis. We should work to keep their operations in Austin, not stifle them."

I think that's all I care to say about this camp, never mind that I find it really suspicious that a lot of people are pro-government-regulation all of a sudden (an exercise - look who's really promoting this sentiment and who they get donations from), and that [articles covering this point](http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/opinion/dont-let-lyft-uber-take-city-for-a-ride-vote-again/nrJGk/) positively *reek* of bias. So that brings me to the third and final camp, one that I swear exist.

### 3. Uber and Lyft have been annoying me with their campaigns for Prop 1 and I'm voting against them just because I think they're annoying

I have no words for you. No words.

Guess that's about it for my rant about Prop 1. I don't know why I feel so strongly about this issue - I don't even rideshare that often. I guess it's because I've seen this before with other political issues, and it frustrates me that innovation always gets stiffled for the most inane reasons. Ultimately this goes beyond ridesharing regulations; Austinites have inadvertently sent a message to other tech companies today -  that Austin rejects them, just like London, Toronto, Vancouver etc has, and that makes me very sad.
