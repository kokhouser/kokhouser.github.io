<p>
	So. It's been a almost a month since I've arrived here in Leuven, Belgium, and I realize I haven't pushed a blog post like I promised last time. <br><br>
	Yeah, erm, sorry about that. <br><br>
	I have good reason(s) though! My procrastinating nature aside, my internet here at the new apartment is HORRIBLE. Just when I overcame the first obstacle (procrastination), and sat down to start typing, I realized that I needed to install both Git and Jekyll on my newly-reformatted-3-year-old laptop.<br><br>

	I never thought I'd see the day that I yearn for good ol' Malaysian UniFi internet here in the First World. However, that's probably the only complaint I have so far about living in Leuven. And so I present to you.. <br><br>

	<center><b><strike>5</strike> <strike>10</strike> A BUNCH of things about Belgium.</b></center>

<p>
	<strike>Everything</strike> Most things here are beautiful. The people, the buildings, the food, the beer, the culture. Even after four weeks here, I count myself insanely lucky to be able to walk for hours after work just to gaze at the sheer beauty of everything around me.<br> <br>
	Leuven itself is a university town, or as like to call it, a Univer City. Instead of the central, contiguous campus we're accustomed to in the States, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KUL) literally is diffused throughout the city. The Religious Faculty could be on the West side, while the Computer Science department can completely be on the other side of town (which admittedly is only about 5-7 miles away). I would like to go on the record and say that having everything within walking and cycling distance is a godsend. It cost me 47 Euros to rent a bike for three months here, and with it I could literally go anywhere in town. <br> <br>

<p>
	That right there is my favorite spot in Leuven, ironically since I've only actually been there twice. It's the Oude Markt (Old Market), located almost right smack in the middle of Leuven. Famous for the "World's Longest Cafe", people here know it actually as the "World's Longest Pub". Walk by there on a Thursday night and you'd see thousands of students just lounging, enjoying a chilled beverage and hanging out. Pretty cool. <br> <br>

<p>
	I love my apartment. It's surprisingly affordable and internet problems (as well as a chronically-smoking neighbour) aside, is actually a pretty sweet place to live. Not pictured is the completely utilitarian kitchenette and shower area. Up the precariously-looking ladder-staircase is a tiny loft-y area with my bed and skylight. Of course, I wouldn't have gotten this sweet place if it wasn't for the folks at AIESEC. Which I guess gives me my opportunity to give a shoutout to the folks from <a href = "http://aiesec.be/">AIESEC</a>. The peeps over at my company worked with them to help integrate me, presumably to "get my productivity up to snuff as soon as possible". I guess it's safe to say that without them, I'd probably be lying in a ditch somewhere after American Airlines inexplicably lost my luggage for the fourth time in 3 years. A special shoutout to my buddy Thomas (also with AIESEC) who woke up early during my first day at work to show me how the buses here work.<br><br>

<br>
</p>

<p>
	So every morning I wake up at 7 and cycle about 10 minutes to the bus station. I tried cycling all the way to work once, and long story short, Google Maps took me through a literal farm, uphill, to get me there. It'll probably be a while before I try that again. Anyway, I forgot how much I loved competent public transportation. Everything's on time, and the best part is that my bus fare is subsidized by the company I work for. Score. <br><br>

	Speaking of work, for those interested, I'm mainly tasked with writing automated unit and integration tests for software that makes other software compatible with 3D printers. That's pretty much the simplest way I can describe it. I realize it may not be as cool as what I did last year (developing experimental Android app prototypes for 3D printing), but eh, it's honest work. I'll save the gnitty-gritty details on automated testing and 3D printing in general for a later, more technical blog post. (There I go again, making promises.) <br> <br>
</p>

<p>
	What more can I say? I'm having really, really enjoying my time here. Being alone in an exciting new place, working for an exciting company, in a new country, I really can't complain. <br><br>

	I suppose what I CAN do is write all about how I ghetto-cooked chicken curry in my kitchenette using ingredients from the (many) asian supermarkets.<br><br>

	Or about how I occasionally (Read:most of the time) get too lazy to cook but am too cheap to buy anything besides 5-Euro kebab wraps (which are delicious by the way) from the countless Middle Eastern eateries here. <br><br>

	Or maybe about the most amazing beaurocratic experience I had registering with the town hall and applying for bank account when I first got here. <br><br>

	I suppose even about how my old boss took me on a grand tour behind the curtain where I work to see all the industrial-grade 3D printers we had on site. <br><br>

	Buttttt I can feel the ole procrastination gene acting up again, so I guess most of those points deserve their own blog post in the future. I promise. <br><br> 

	Maybe. <br><br>

	Till next time! Rest assured that I'm having a blast, and there's nothing here that'll make me upse- <br><br>

		PS: I know I've already talked about <a href = "http://waitbutwhy.com/" target="_blank">WaitButWhy</a> in my last post, but he recently posted a piece on <http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html>Elon Musk</a> as well as a related piece on <http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html>Tesla (the car company)</a>, which are both topics I'm convinced are ultra-important for us as a modern civilization moving forward. Do yourself a favour and spend the hour or so necessary to go through these incredibly-written posts. <br><br>

		PPS: Ok. Between the time I drafted and published this blog post, I had an experience I simply must share that pretty much sums up all my anxious interactions here in Leuven.<br><br>

		After deciding once-and-for-all to solve a few problems that's been plaguing me, I decided to head to the nearest supermarket to buy three items - a bottle of facial wash so I can begin fighting my acne problem (way to go HaoZhe, I'm sure everyone wanted to know that), a (cheap-yet-decent) knife, so I don't have to keep "borrowing" my neighbour's whenever I want to cook, as well as a peeler so I don't have to eat curry with potatoes that still have the skin on. (Thought: It'd be pretty awkward to mix those items and their purposes up). <br><br>
		Seeing as it was getting late and everything closes early here, I decided to try shopping at Colruyt's for once instead of Carrefour since it was closer. There, I decided not to grab a trolley seeing as how I only needed to hold three items, and I had my backpack with me. Queue the anxiousness when I head to the checkout counters. <br><br>

		HaoZhe's Brain: Okay I'm third in line. Everyone seems to have a trolley maybe it's like a rule or something here. Never mind just act casual. <br><br>
		HaoZhe's Brain: Wait why are those girls handing the cashier guy a card, oh no is that like a member card? Is this like Costco where I'm just not allowed to shop at all without a membership? <br><br>
		HaoZhe's Brain: Maybe it's nothing. Oh no, the Cashier Dude looks disgruntled, I guess he's maybe.. slightly older than my age? Late twenties for sure. Crap what if he doesn't speak English? He looks like the kind of guy who doesn't, and the kind of guy that'll be mad at me for not knowing Dutch. <br><br>
		HaoZhe's Brain: Okay I'm now second in line, the Old Lady in front just gave him a card too! That MUST be a membership card. OMG OMG. Maybe I can just casually leave my stuff somewhere and walk out. But no, I'm a foreigner. They'll probably think I'm stealing something. Curse my decision to bring my backpack along. <br><br>
		HaoZhe's Brain: Dammit I forgot I'm out of cash. And I have no idea how to work a chip-and-pin machine. I fail as a college student. <br><br>
		HaoZhe's Brain: Okay calm down. Worst-case scenario Cashier Guy gets mad and tells me to leave the stuff in a basket somewhere and leave. I should've known better than to stray away from Carrefour. Oh look the Old Lady's done, now he's gonna notice me next and the fireworks can start.<br><br>
		Cashier Guy: *Notices I'm carrying a bunch of stuff. Also notices I'm not Belgian probably and switches to impeccable English with a British accent* Hey man, you know you can just leave the stuff here at the counter and not carry them right? *smiles* Do you have a card with us?<br><br>
		HaoZhe: Uhm... uh. No.<br><br>
		Cashier Guy: No problem! May I check your backpack please? <br><br>
		HaoZhe: Uhm.. sure. *Hands over backpack. Sure that somehow something stolen would end up in there because anxiety.* <br><br>
		Cashier Guy: All good, I'm really sorry about checking. Unfortunately I have to do this every time. Store policy. *smiles* That'll be 15 Euros please. <br><br>
		HaoZhe uses the chip-and-pin machine awkwardly. <br><br>
		Cashier Guy: Thank you, have a great day! <br><br>
		HaoZhe: ... Thankyouyoutoo. *walks out quickly, relieved* <br><br>
		<b>Godspeed, Cashier-Senpai.</b>
