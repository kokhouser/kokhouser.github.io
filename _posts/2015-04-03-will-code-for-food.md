	<b>Disclaimer: The following post may be controversial as I talk about some of the more sensitive issues regarding foreign employment in the United States. If you have strong feelings about the issue, I'd love to discuss if you're willing.

	If you've applied to a job in the United States, chances are you've seen something like this:- <br><br>

	It's true, companies care about diversity and the positive image it brings to them. Hell, even Microsoft has <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/inside-microsoft/asians-at-microsoft/default.aspx#fbid=zhbTqGJ98Qj" target="_blank">a page</a> just to show off their Asians! <br><br>
	So, the reason why most of the companies in the U.S proudly boast that they're an Equal Employment Employer is because of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits the discrimination of potential employees based on their  race, sex, creed, religion, color, or <b>national origin</b>. The reason I have that last one in bold is because it is complete and utter bullcrap (it's true, open the above image in a separate tab and look at the name of the image file).<br>

	The above image is a screengrab of a spreadsheet I have to keep track of my internship applications. I've applied to more than 60 different companies for a shot at a Summer internship. Most don't reply, and the ones that do never have good news. The companies I've applied to also run the gamut from huge corporations to startups. Yet not a single one have offered me even a preliminary screening interview, and that's because I've already been screened when I answer this one question:- <br> <br>

	Yes, the dreaded visa sponsorship question. Here are some facts: - <br> <br>
	<b>Most foreign people need visa sponsorship to work in the United States</b><br>
	This is true for most places in the world as well. Foreigners, are by definition, not of American origin, and thus require some form of work authorization to gain lawful employment here in the U.S.<br><br>
	<b>Companies view sponsoring a visa for a foreign worker as a serious investment.</b><br>
	And they are not wrong! Sponsoring a visa is a serious investment in terms of time and money. Therefore, it is understandable that companies would want to make sure that they are absolutely confident in their candidates before offering to sponsor their visa.<br><br>
	<b>However, companies assume wrongly that they have to filter candidates purely based on national origin.</b><br>
	This is where (I think) most corporations trip up. Clearly, the best way to gauge if a potential employee is deserving of sponsorship is through a merit assessment, some way to evaluate their skills in the workplace. Which is why..<br><br>
	<b>Students with an F1 Student Visa are allowed to complete an internship in the U.S with little-to-no paperwork required of the employer.</b><br>
	Through a magical thing called <a href ="http://www.visaservices.duke.edu/F1_CPT.html" target="_blank">Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</a>, International Students in the States can apply for work authorization. Unlike the H1B work visa, the CPT actually has an extremely high approval rate (I personally do not know of anyone whose application was declined). The CPT enables a student to complete an internship for up to 12(!) months, which you would notice is a longer period than most internships here in the States.<br><br>
	<b>What if your employer still isn't convinced? Well, International Students still can work after graduation.</b><br>
	Through a relatively easy process (relative to the rest of the bureaucracy involving foreigners of course), an International Student can apply for a student to do Optional Practical Training (OPT). This allows a recent graduate to work for any employer for up to 12(!) months. Ample time for evaluation, in my opinion.<br><br>
	<b>Well what if my opinion is wrong? STEM graduates can extend their OPT as well.</b><br>
	That's right! International graduates with a degree in science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) are eligible to apply for a 17(!) month extension to their OPT, resulting in a total evaluation period of (12+12+17=) 41 months before one needs a work visa. That's more commitment to a single company than some full-time employees!
	<br><br>
</p>

<p>
	Sadly, despite these facts, my applications were swiftly declined, even after spelling out everything I've said above in the application. In fact, in one case I literally got two emails after my application:- One to thank me for applying, and another to apologize because I was rejected due to "giving unsatisfactory answers on my diversity questions." I've even had multiple instances where a classmate who had relatively equal experience and skills as I did obtain an interview opportunity while I was swiftly rejected by the same company.<br><br>

	It is clear to me now that the barrier to entry for International Students seeking to obtain lawful employment in the States is too high for me right now, and so I've given up on my year-long search for an internship for the Summer.<br><br>

	However, I am very pleased to say that I finally have some good news. As of today, it is very likely that I will be accepting an offer to once again intern at <a href= "http://materialise.com/">Materialise</a>. I've completed an internship with them before back home in Malaysia, and I had a blast helping them develop Android apps. However, this time my internship will probably be much different, as I'll actually be flying out to their headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. Naturally, I am extremely excited about this opportunity, as well as the chance to travel the EU, which is something I've always wanted to do. <br><br>
	As of right now, my plans are not totally solidified, and so there's still a chance something might go horribly wrong (like for instance, not being able to purchase an affordable plane ticket), but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited. I'll definitely be blogging if I do end up going to Belgium.<br><br>
	So, thus concludes my (rather-lengthy) post about my struggles with the U.S foreign worker system, as well as my happy announcement. If any of my readers have any suggestions about anything I've said (ways to further subvert the whole visa thing, offers for accommodations whilst I'm in the EU, tips for cheap plane ticket prices etc) or if you want to talk about anything I've written about, I'd be happy to hear them! <br><br>
	Unfortunately I haven't gotten around to implementing comments on the site, and thus I implore you to either message me at any of the links below, message me on Facebook (if we're friends), or shoot me an email at hzk11a@acu.edu.<br><br>

	Till next time!
