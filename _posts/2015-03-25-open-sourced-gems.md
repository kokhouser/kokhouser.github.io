<p>
Hello readers, it certainly has been a while, and I really do apologize for the lack of posts. It's just that I've been swamped lately with projects and other obligations. Though, I really shouldn't use that as an excuse, as I still get a decent amount of time off. Perhaps I'm just not into the habit of blogging regularly yet.</p>

<p>
On the bright side, I may have some really great news to share within the next few weeks (though I seriously hope I'm not jumping the gun, or jinxing myself, by saying something here), so watch this bleargh for further details soon(tm).
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I just though I'd share some open-source libraries that I've found interesting during my trawling of the Interwebz. These run the gamut from web development to mobile, and have no relation to one another besides having caught my interest at some point in time. (Protip: The teal-ish links takes you to the project's Github page. Pretty handy! #Web2.0.1)

	This is something cool a classmate of mine drew my attention to a while ago. Basically it's a video chat client in your very own terminal window. Yes, using ASCII art. And if that's not amazing enough, it even comes in color. Though I'm not sure if anyone will practically use this to do video chat - it has a slight delay to encode the characters - still very cool.

	If you're anything like me (and I'm sure you're not), then you've been frustrated more than once by a person who just doesn't speak the same language as you in a Dota2 game. "Cyka pizdec nahui puta madre bobo" probably isn't a diverse enough vocabulary to communicate in such a situation. Well, fret no longer! This program runs alongside a Dota2 client and intercepts incoming messages, translates them to English, and outputs them right in the game itself.

	Competent source control is, in my opinion, one of the more underrated skills a budding software developer should have. I believe that the importance of source control for collaboration and backup warrants it being a priority for it to be mastered. "When do I commit?", "Why do I have to push?", "Just what in the f*ck is 'merge'??", all these are questions I used to regularly ask, and still regularly hear from my peers. Learn Git Branching was the tool that finally made everything clear to me, and came at a very valuable time - while I was working on introducing Git to my team during my internship. It's graphical too, which separates it from all the other dull tutorials out there.

	A curated list of pretty awesome things. Just bits and pieces of information and resources that should be in every programmer's (and programming enthusiast's) toolbox.

	Similar to the above entry, Android Arsenal is an invaluable resource for anyone looking to get serious about Android development. It's a well-maintained list of open-sourced libraries that can be easily imported and utilized in an Android project. Need an XML parser (eww)? A REST handler (more like it)? Cards, but hate Google's implementation? All of the above, and more, are available through AndArse.

And that just about wraps up my rundown of a few things that caught my fancy. Like I've said, I hope to update the Bleargh soon with a new post I have in the works, as soon as I confirm the good news that I'm just dying to share. Till next time!
