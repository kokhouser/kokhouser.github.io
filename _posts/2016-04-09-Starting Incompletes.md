Oh. It's you.

_shuffles feet_

Well. Here we are again. You, dear Constant Reader, who's probably disappointed at my lack of consistency when it comes to these blogs. And me, aforementioned disappointment. 

Look, there really isn't much for me to say. It's clear that if you keep coming back, I can just do whatever I want with my posting frequencies, because any promises I make won't really matter. 

It's not you, it's me. And also you. 

I'm afraid this dysfunctional relationship will just have to go on.

Now that we've got that uncomfortable reconciliation out of the way, I figured I'd start it all off in true HaoZhe fashion, with some recommendations!

# Podcasts

#### [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/)

I wouldn't be surprised if you're *already* listening to Hello Internet, what with it's crazy-huge (and generally plain crazy) viewerbase. This conversational podcast literally is just that - two dudes from the internet recording a fortnightly conversation. You know, of regular conversational topics. Like the existence of free will. Or the merits of hotstoppers. 

Or if the Jamaican Rice Rat can be the official rice rat of the podcast.

To call them "two dudes from the internet" *may* be doing them a little bit of a disservice though. Brady Haran, the talkative, brutally-Australian one runs a whole slew of YouTube channels including [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile) and [Periodic Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos), while CGP Grey, the methodical and rational robot one, runs his own [educational YouTube channel a well](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey).

The podcast has really grown into this weird quasi-nation. They have their own official rice rat, swamp hen, and yes - [a flag](http://www.hellointernet.fm/flagvote/). These guys are 70% of the reason I giggle during work.

#### [Stuff You Should Know](http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/)

A household podcast name by now (8 years on the air and counting), the whole point of SYSK is in the name - Josh Clark and Chuck Bryant, are two writers from [HowStuffWorks](http://www.howstuffworks.com/) and break down topics from cats (a fairly recent episode) to quantum suicide (unbelievably, more fascinating than it sounds.

Josh and Chuck go at it from the most laymen of perspective, do their research, and present them in their trademark conversational style. If you ever need to know about things you'll most likely *won't* need to know, SYSK is the way to go.

#### [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/)

A very recent addition to my podcast library, 99PI advertizes itself as being a design podcast, but I think it's much more than that. The podcast is hosted by Roman Mars, who aside from having a badass name, also has a badass voice for podcasting. He leads a team of producers out of an architecture firm in Oakland, California (as he's wont to remind us during the closing of each episode), and they present the show much like an audio documentary. 

They focus on the little hidden gems (hence the name) of history, design, architecture society and philosophy, and they pour their hearts and souls into each one. This shows, as the episodes are expertly produced, with the week's host providing passing narration while their interviewees and experts taking center stage in explaining the subject. All of this is laid on top of soothing background music and aptly-chosen ambient sound effects, depending on the subject in question.

The reason I've fallen in love with this podcast is because it really reveals little delightful details that often are ommited from history books, because in the grand scheme of things, who cares about Soul City, the failed all-black city proposed and built in the mid 20th century? Or about "liquid-ass", the foul-smelling chemical compound discovered by a child and used to train military personnel in highly-realistic gore simulations?

But that's the point, 99PI aims to open our eyes to the little things, because only when we start appreciating the annonymous thought that goes into oft-overlooked aspects of our lives, like the statues in our parks, or the arches in our cathedrals, can we appreicate our lives as a whole just a little more.  

For a great example of Roman Mars' ability to make people care about things nobody cares about, check out his [TED Talk on flags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4). Yes, he gave a TED Talk on flags.

I *did* plan on writing of other recommendations beyond podcasts, but it seems I've already gushed too much. I'll save the next section for another blog post. Maybe.

PS: I seem to be running into occasional downtime and would like to collaborate with people on projects. If anyone would like to do non-profity things (or other things), feel free to shoot me an email.

PPS: I am really-really-super-hyped for Rogue One, since the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wji-BZ0oCwg) came out a few days ago.
