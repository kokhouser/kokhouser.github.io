	Okay, I've finally gotten the site to a state where I'm seriously considering publishing. If all goes accordingly, this post might even get read by tonight.
</p>

<p>
	I figured that I'd start out with a series detailing how I've gotten this site up and running, possibly all three major iterations of it. I haven't been taking screenshots though, so it'll be very textual, though I promise I'll *try* to be a little more detailed with documenting my further escapades.
</p>

<p>
	I guess it all started with me finding out about <a href="https://domains.google.com/">Google Domains</a>, through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZbbfICteBs">this Google I/O video</a>. Curious, and feeling like I never sign up for early betas enough, I gave it a go. Surprisingly, I received my invite pretty quickly, but seeing as I had no plans (at the time) not the money to invest in a website, I sat on my invite, unused, for almost a year.
</p>

<p>
	Fast forward to early January of this year. I've started my Web Development course, and really quickly crash-coursed through the early introduction to HTML and CSS. Both were technologies I had already dabbled with since my first exposure to the web, but had never actually spent time getting better-acquainted with. After a disastrous first class project (the details of which I wish not go into), I've realized that not only did I understand basic web development well, but that I actually enjoyed doing it.
</p>

<p>
	So began my thoughts on creating this very site. Being fortunate enough to have access to Google Domains, I decided upon a domain name (Refer to the FAQ for why I chose it) and took the plunge. And then.. I floundered.
</p>

<p>
	For a few weeks I didn't really know what I wanted to do. It turns out that there are many, many options open to prospective website owners in terms of hosting, frameworks, and design. After going through much literature online, I narrowed my choices down to the following three:
</p>

<p>
	<b>1. Using the Wordpress framework and either self-hosting or using a server-renting service:</b> <br>
	I decided against this very early on, mainly because my previous blog was already Wordpress and I've gotten bored of it, but also because I think Wordpress sites are just too common. :P
</p>

<p>
	<b>2. Completely design my own frontend and backend and hosting it on my own/renting a server:</b> <br>
	This was extremely appealing to the CS nerd in me. I had thought out exactly how I wanted everything to function had I actually chose this route. Ultimately, I decided against this idea for a variety of reasons. Among them being that I figured it'd be too time consuming, that I still had a lot to learn before actually being ready to do it in a reasonable amount of time, and finally, that it'd cost a lot of money for a project that I wasn't too sure I'd follow-though with till the end yet. I actually had a server host picked out before I finally ditched this plan.
</p>

<p>
	<b>3. Finding a compromise between the first two options and hosting the site through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>:</b> <br>
	The wonderful magic of hind-sight has revealed that I chosen this option, again for a variety of reasons. For starters, the fact that I'd be learning Jekyll, something I've been wanting to dabble with for a while now, was really appealing to me. Also, there's something elegant about being this close to self-creating a site from scratch, yet relying on lightweight frameworks to do a lot of the heavy-lifting. As a professor of mine keeps reminding us - "Why reinvent the wheel?"<br>
	<br>
	Oh, and did I mention that it's free? Yes, the only thing I've spent money on is the $12 flat yearly fee to own this domain. Talk about thriftiness.
</p>

<p>
	I also want to take this opportunity to plug <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> once more. This (free!) alternative to host static HTML and Markdown pages on a repository has been a godsend for me and countless others (I'm sure). Not only can I work on the design offline and test it out locally through an extremely-lightweight Jekyll server, publishing is literally a regular Git commit and push. Although I'm sure there will be some caveats I'll have to deal with further down the road (no PHP scripting or backend of any sort comes to mind easily), I'm really happy with how things are set up now. 
</p>

<p>
	My next blog post will be a step-by-step on how I actually set everything up and <b>should</b> kick off a more technical side of blogging - one I haven't done much before, but am eager to try. 
</p>

<p>
	Until then!
