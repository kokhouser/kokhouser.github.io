			<h2>Hello World?</h2>
		</header>
		<p><strong>Welcome!</strong> As you, dear <strong>Constant Reader</strong>, can see, I’ve finally gotten a domain name to call my own. I’ve also taken the plunge and decided to assert more control over my site/blog by building it from (almost-sorta-kinda) scratch. Thrice now.</p>
		<hr />
		<header><h2>Function<h2></header>

		<p>As previously mentioned, I’ll mostly be using this site for two main purposes.</p>

		<h3>As a professional hub:</h3>

		<p>In the forseeable future, I hope to have most of the projects I’m proud of shown off on this site through a code portfolio of sorts. In the meantime, there’s a handy link to my GitHub page on the top right of this page.

		Furthermore, I plan to also blog more about the technical aspects of the things I do. This is so I can keep a log detailing my exploration of my first love - technology, as well as to hopefully provide tutorials that may one day help others.</p>

		<h3>As a personal hub:</h3>

		<p>I’ll be migrating my personal blog (“Bleargh” on the navbar) onto this site as well. Whether or not I end up sticking to a consistent posting schedule is still up for speculation. :)</p>

			This site is almost completely powered by <strong>Jekyll</strong>. This is actually the third iteration of the site, as I previously went with <strong>Jekyll Bootstrap</strong>.

			<strong>Jekyll-Bootstrap</strong> combines <strong>Jekyll</strong>, a powerful parsing engine that’s kind of the halfway point between a generic blogging platform and building a blog from scratch (their documentation calls it a “static-site engine”, which I guess is fancy-talk for making self-contained webpages), and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, Twitter’s easy-to-use design framework. The reason I went with Bootstrap is because I had dabbled with it briefly for classes, and I found it easy to use, albeit rather bland after a while. <br>
			<br>
			However, between the time I’ve started working on it and the time I ditched the Bootstrap component, I’ve found that JB was horribly bloated for very little gain. The developer also had stopped maintaining the library many months prior to me actually using it. Therefore, right now I’m running vanilla Jekyll, made pretty by TEMPLATED's Linear theme.<br>
			<br>
			The thing I love about Jekyll so far is that I end up using Markdown to pretty up my content. Having dabbled with MD a while ago while constructing the project page for my loved-but-neglected <strong>Android Simplified Drawer</strong>, I’ve fallen for its simplicty and elegance. Its integration (through plugins) with Sublime Text is just icing on the cake.<br>
			<br>
			The technologies I’ve chosen are subject to change, as this site is as much as learning tool as it is a personal-professional hub.
