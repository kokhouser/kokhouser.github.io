	<b>Who the heck are you?</b><br>
	Hi.<br>
	My name is Hao Zhe Kok (or any one of the different aliases people have referred to me by).<br>
	I'm an Undergrad Computer Science Major currently studying in Abilene Christian University(ACU), Texas. I am expected to graduate this December (2015), and aspire to be a decent software engineer someday.<br>
	I'm originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and am of Malaysian-Chinese descent.<br>
	I've done an internship for <a href="http://materialise.com/">Materialise</a>, and am currently Dev Lead for ACU's student-run software company.<br>
	This seems like a good place for me to stop giving out personal details. At this rate, my OKCupid profile might go out of business.

	<b>So why <strike><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHrn_pHW2so">male models</a></strike> Computer Science?</b><br>
	To be honest, it wasn't ever planned, and I'm quite unsure why I stumbled into CS at all.<br>
	Being a mostly-shut-in boy, I naturally gravitated towards computer games. And though it'd be easy to say that I've always wanted to make video games, and that they inspired me to pursue CS, that wouldn't be the truth. <br>
	I know a lot of people also get exposed to some flavour of CS earlier on, in high school, but I can't say that I had that privilege, considering the sorry state that the Malaysian public school system is in. <br>
	I guess if I were to be totally honest, me ending up almost graduating with a Computer Science degree is probably an extremely unlikely fluke. However, what a beautiful fluke it has been. I can't think of anything else I'd rather be doing in life.<br>
	Except of course, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=alpaca+peddler&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=IMH4VInnKo-eyASApoHYDA&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAg&biw=1920&bih=965">alpaca peddling.</a>

	<b>How did you go about picking such a horrible domain name?</b><br>
	Well, you see - HEY! It's an extremely clever name, and here's why.<br>
	It's obviously a play on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), a term thrown about so much for anyone who wants to seem "QuIrKy" and "ohmaigot I'm so OCD", that it has lost all meaning. OCM is meant to be a call-out as well as a meta-joke about how I'm using it wrongly too, also known as a misnomer.<br>
	Also, I'd like to think that if OCD is a compulsive drive to repeat obsessive behaviors, OCM would be a drive to repeatedly using the wrong terms and phrases ignorantly. Something I occasionally catch myself being guilty of.<br>
	So? Clever huh? <br>
	Why are you groaning?<br>
	Whatever, it's funnier if I didn't have to explain it. In the immortal words of Edward Snowden - <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/cour5r0">"This kills the joke."</a>

	<b>Do you always use annoying meta-humour?</b><br><br>

	<b>What do you do to pass time? And since you're the one anticipating questions and know you'll say 'reading', what books do you read?</b><br>
	Okay I think I should dial down some of the meta, and take some schizo pills.<br>
	To answer your(my) question though, I've been enjoying a lot of good Science Fiction lately. <b>Ender's Shadow</b> was a really, really good one that stood out to me, and that made me want to seek out more like it. More recently, I've read <b>Starship Troopers</b>, and <b>The Martian</b> (which is getting the Hollywood treatment). Both I highly recommend if you're, you know, into that sort of thing. <br>
	I've also enjoyed Stephen King's latest, <b>Revival</b>, and aim to start Phillip K Dick's <b>The Man In The High Castle</b>.<br>
	Also, for a Data-Mining class, I'm in the process of reading <b>Freakonomics</b>.
