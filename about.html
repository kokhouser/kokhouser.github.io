## About

A (not very) long time ago, in a galaxy that's pretty much this one, I had blog after blog (and a site). I'd obsess about making them *just* right, throw up some content, make efforts to keep them updated, and inevitably abandon them. With a spiffy new domain name (the old one was too clunky), and a <a href = "https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme">fancy new theme</a>, this is where my side projects and blog now live, until I get bored and start a new site.

I am a software developer from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia currently located in Austin, Texas. Right now I specialise in various web technologies and tinker around with too many unfinished side projects. I also have ~4 years of experience with C/C++, Java (Android), Python, Ruby, PHP, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and all other sorts of pseudo-words. In my free time I like cooking, biking, gaming, reading and thinking about the cool things I hope to see someday.
