<p>
	An Android library which provides a simple activity class to extend from to enable both left and right navigation drawers. <br><br>
	I worked on this library using intermediate knowledge of the Android SDK garnered from a three-month internship developing Android applications. <br>
	<br>
	The current version of ASD supports extremely basic drawer functionality. It removes a lot of boilerplate code needed to make navigation drawers work. <br>
	<br>
	A DrawerActivity class is provided to be extended by any activity that uses a drawer.<br>
	<br>
	A DrawerManager class is also provided to be used to initialize drawers.<br>
	<br>
	As of this version, ASD provides basic, one-layout type of drawer items, containing a single icon and its label. In the future, I hope to provide support for custom drawer item types on both drawers (left and right).<br>

<header><h2><a href="https://github.com/tfrank64/StringManip">StringManip (2014)</a></h2></header><br>
<p>
	A helper string class for C++ that adds string functionality from Ruby and Objective-C Foundation library that aims to alleviate some problems with string manipulation that C++ inherently has. <br><br>
	This was developed as a project for an Object-Oriented Design class in Spring 2014. <br>
	<br>
	<b>As of writing, the functions available through the helper class include: </b><br>
	<br>
	<strong>chomp(String x):</strong> That returns string x with trailing endlines removed.<br>
	<strong>chomp(String x, String substring):</strong> Filters and removes substring from string x.<br>
	<strong>toSentence(String* stringArray, int n):</strong> Accepts a string array of size n and returns a sentence using the words in the array.<br>
	<strong>toSentence(String* stringArray, int n, String modifier):</strong> Same as above, with a custom sentence modifier.<br>
	<strong>toUpper(String x):</strong> Coverts all characters in the string x to uppercase.<br>
	<strong>capitalize(String x):</strong> <strike>Obtain profits.</strike> Capitalizes the first character in string x.<br>
	<strong>replaceOccurences(String x, String oldStr, String newStr):</strong> Given strings x, oldStr and newStr, replaces all occurences of oldStr with newStr.<br>
	<strong>explode(String x, String delimiter):</strong> Given string x, returns a vector containing all words in the string, seperated by given delimiter.<br>
	<strong>implode(Vector x, String joiner):</strong> Given a vector x, returns a string containing all words in the vector, seprated by given joiner.<br>
	<strong>wordCount(String x):</strong> Returns number of words in string x as an integer.<br>
